# Ruby CSV to YAML Converter

A simple Ruby script to convert CSV lists to YAML.

The original script is from Gist and can be found
[here] (https://gist.github.com/potatosalad/893073).

To use this script, simply run it from the terminal:

    $ ruby csv-to-yaml.rb /path/to/csvfile

## TODO

+   Have the script actually output a YAML file
